# Mission-Chatbot
Trying to create a chatbot for facebook messenger. Chatbots are mostly locally biased and are suitable for the reason they are trained. This would be my own chatbot for replying the messages in my facebook though the data is not as clean as any standard data source. From what I've read so far in multiple research papers is that the complexity or stacking of the LSTM rarely helps improve the model though it will depend upon the case itself.  Attention based LSTM are said to be mora accurate than the normal LSTM as well as stacked LSTM. So we intend to go first with normal LSTM and  compare its performance with attention model. We would be using Word2vec model to train create our own word vectors as words like 'k gardai xas ' would rarely be present in any standard data source. The most intensive task in this approcah are the data preprocessing and tuning of parameters.
